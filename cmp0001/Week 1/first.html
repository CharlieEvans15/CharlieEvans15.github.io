<ul>1 tsp bicarbonate of soda</ul>
<ul>½ tsp salt</ul>
<ul>110g/4oz butter, plus extra for greasing</ul>

<ul>1 tsp vanilla extract</ul>

<h2>Method </h2>
Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Grease a 20x12.5cm/8x5in loaf tin (also known as 900g/2lb).

Sift the flour, bicarbonate of soda and salt into a large mixing bowl.

In a separate bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy.

Add the eggs, mashed bananas, buttermilk and vanilla extract to the butter and sugar mixture and mix well. Fold in the flour mixture.

Pour the banana bread mixture into the prepared tin.

Bake for about an hour (check after 45 minutes), or until well-risen and golden-brown.

Remove from the oven and cool in the tin for a few minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely before serving.
